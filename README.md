## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I currently work at Highline College in their Institutional Research office. I graduated from the University of Chicago's Master of Science in Computational Analytics for Public Policy program in 2021. I'm also a massive community college / open access education fan, a visual artist and lover of learning.
